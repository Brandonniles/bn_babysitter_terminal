Babysitter Calculator (Terminal Version)

developed by Brandon Niles

The babysitter:

- starts no earlier than 5:00PM
- leaves no later than 4:00AM
- gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
- gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
- gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
- gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)

The babysitter will clock in.         (Enter her start time)
The babysitter will then clock out.   (Enter her leave time)
The app will then calculator the amount she will charge the customer based on the rules above.
This app runs completely from terminal or the command prompt.
